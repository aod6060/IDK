This is a simple game I'll be working on the cristmas Holiday.


It requires DirectX9 in order for some one to play, I'll also add

a link to the assets later one so there will be graphics. 

To compile the application you'll need to have VS2010, VS2010 Express or later.


Description of the Game:

The game its self will be a simple 4 way shooter, were the players objective is to 
survive an onslot of enemies. He/She right now is a smilly block of dev art lol. 

For right now because I don't have the assets uploaded to an file loading site even if you 
compile this application right now. So tomarrow I'll upload the other assets to a file sharing
sharing site tomarrow unless git up has file sharing which I'll check tomarrow.
